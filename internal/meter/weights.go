// Package meter turns a Claude response's token usage into two comparable
// numbers: weighted tokens (every model normalized onto one scale so a person's
// contribution is comparable across models) and USD cost. It is the piece the
// retired usage-monitor got wrong in two specific ways, both fixed here:
//
//   - It counted only input+output, ignoring cache tokens. We count all four
//     (input, output, cache-creation, cache-read), each at its own rate.
//   - It guessed an unknown model's weight by family substring, which once
//     overcharged the whole fleet 50%. Here an unmatched model is reported as
//     unknown (Known=false) and never silently inherits another model's rate.
