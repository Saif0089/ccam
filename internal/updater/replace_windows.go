// ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED and the update simply never lands, quietly, for
// as long as the machine exists.
//
// So: try unprivileged, and ask for elevation only when Windows has
// actually refused. Nothing prompts on an ordinary per-user install,
// which is what keeps CI (and every normal machine) prompt-free — the
// e2e run never reaches this branch because it never hits a directory
